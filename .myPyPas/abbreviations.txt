There's a limited number of chars per line, sometimes it is more descriptive to use them to describe stuff instead of
writing some obnoxiously long words over and over again when most people can understand the abbreviation.

Abbreviations policy: Only words that are pretty long & have to be written all the time & were their abbreviation is
at least somewhat readable & were abbreviating them will produce an overall significant char save & were their
abbreviation is somewhat beautiful shall be abbreviated.
Note: Some of the less obvious abbreviations are used semi-inconsistently, this is by design, do not rename for
the sake of consistency, only for the sake of readability.

Canonical example: Repository -> Repo. Understood by anyone, might as well remove the "sitory" from the official word,
saves an entire 6 chars per mention, is used everywhere & somewhat beautiful

List of the abbreviations currently in use in case anyone is confused or wants to auto-rename:
tdv == trading_data_visualizer
repo == repository
conn == connection
pfol == portfolio
infra == infrastructure
hist == history
yf == yahoo_finance


P.D. Some abbreviations are so commonly used didn't even bother to mention like CLI, DB etc.
