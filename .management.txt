How to use:
    - If a pull request is submitted with an appropriate solution to a task in "Will do" it may be accepted.
    - If a pull request is submitted with an appropriate solution to a task in "Could do" it may be accepted with less
    probability than will do.
    - If a pull request is submitted with an appropriate solution to some other task it may be accepted with even less
    probability.

Will do, ordered by priority:

    - Local user:
        - Be able to do simple session requiring operations through CLI:
            - Add/remove/modify portfolio, portfolio shares, portfolio options, account & do analysis

    - Remote user (Operations though http requests and the API):
        - Add/remove/modify portfolio, portfolio shares, portfolio options, account & do analysis: Involves getting
        the API working and making HTTP requests locally with no UI.

    - Code integrity:
        - Refactor code to pass mypy (This is a constant task)
        - Use decimal instead of float for all? floats
        - Use appropriate sizes of data in tables
        - Double check all timestamps to be UTC use server defaults when possible
        - InsertTimeTable insert by default
        - Add an appropriate amount of logging
        - Add an appropriate amount of docstrings

    - DB diagram, update, contract size belongs to strike now, maybe more.

    - Separate Settings from constants, somehow, I think we just use .py for settings, no need to bring .yaml

Could do:

    - Account:
        - Make account secure, passwords etc (use google? way better than handling accounts)

    -Ticker:
        - Historical support: Have a comprehensive set of options downloaded & perform analysis based on timestamps
