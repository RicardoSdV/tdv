Why: Project management is good to improve coordination, efficiency & focusing efforts towards business goals.

How to use:
    - Move tasks to "Is Doing" from "Will Do" & commit to main to make everyone aware
    - Move or add tasks that should be done ASAP to "Will do" after expert consulting & commit to main
    - Add any ideas to "Could do", no need to commit to main
    - Move tasks from "Is Doing" to "Was Done" when task is finished


=======================================================================================================================
Is Doing:
    - Description: Tasks under active development i.e. someone else working on this task will be redundant, add your
    name to know who is doing what. The trend would be for tasks in this section to be more atomic.

    - Tasks:
        - (Ric): Being able to insert all exchanges and tickers
        - (Ric): Normalizing main trading data table
=======================================================================================================================

=======================================================================================================================
Will do:
    - Description: Tasks that will be done relatively shortly. Keep number small, focused, prioritized.

    - Tasks:
        - Account:
            - Session: log in once, work with that rather than passing username or something for every operation

            - Add shares to a portfolio
            - Add options to a portfolio

            - Do analysis

        - Ticker:
            - Live / Historical support hybrid: Download options every certain interval & use the last DB insertion
            as the "live" data to perform analysis.
