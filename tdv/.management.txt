Why: Project management is good to improve coordination, efficiency & focusing efforts towards business goals.

How to use:
    - Move tasks to "Is Doing" from "Will Do" & commit to main to make everyone aware
    - Move or add tasks that should be done ASAP to "Will do" after expert consulting & commit to main
    - Add any ideas to "Could do", no need to commit to main
    - Move tasks from "Is Doing" to "Was Done" when task is finished
