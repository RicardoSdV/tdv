change the logic to run week at a time?

yahoo YFserviceProxy has:
   __market_open = time(hour=9, minute=30)
    __market_close = time(hour=16)
it should also checked for the day, no? (note in c 18 in class YFserviceProxy(BaseServiceProxy):

make sure __is_market_open_today correctly returns true/false by only checking month and day.
